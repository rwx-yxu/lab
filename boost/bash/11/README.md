# Boost week 11 notes

## Review challenge:
* Create a new script from scratch. The script should print "Hello there"
* The logic must be put into a function call.

## Recap:
I used echo rather than printf. I should remember that I can pass
through the parameter when calling the function using '$1' which can be
used for parameter expansion as well.
