# Boost week 16 notes
* Set up Github from terminal.
* Go can ran directly from a file
* Created first challenge
* Every Go file must begin with `package`
* Like Java, every Go program must have a main package and must have a
  main function.
* Go will compile along with the Go runtime which means that the
  binaries that it produces can be a larger compared to C. It
  is still better than Java.
* Go is compatible with C
* Go can be cross compiled.
* Strings in Go must be wrapped in double quotes
